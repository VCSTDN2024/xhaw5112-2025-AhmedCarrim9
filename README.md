Ahmed Carrim – Design Concept: AA Empower
Client Needs Description 
The client, Empowering the Nation, requires a web page and mobile application to promote and manage their skills training business for domestic workers and gardeners. The app and website should allow users to:

- Browse and view detailed information about both six-month and six-week courses
- Calculate fees including automatic discount and VAT
- Submit contact details and course interest forms
- View training locations and contact the organization
Navigation must be easy, professional, and consistent across both platforms.
User-Centred Design Approach 
I followed a user-centred design process by identifying the main types of users:
1. Employers who want to upskill their staff
2. Domestic workers/gardeners aiming to become more employable or start businesses

Key decisions:
- Clear navigation menu with icons and labels
- Each course having its own screen for clarity
- Forms with field validation to ensure smooth user experience
- A responsive layout suitable for all screen sizes

Web Page:

Mobile App:
- Same structure as website, optimized for small screens
- Bottom tab bar for navigation
- Hamburger menu for quick access

Logo Design 
Logo Name: AA Empower
Concept: A bold upward arrow formed by two hands lifting a person, symbolising growth and upliftment. Font: Modern sans-serif. Colours: Blue (trust), Green (growth), Gold (opportunity).
User Personas (Additional Detail)
To better understand our users, we created detailed personas:
- Persona 1: 'Martha', a domestic worker looking to upskill to secure higher pay and start her own small business.
- Persona 2: 'John', a homeowner who wants to enroll his gardener in courses to improve garden maintenance.
These personas guided the intuitive navigation and content prioritization.
Use-Centred Design Approach – Additional Insights
We conducted interviews and surveys with potential users to gather feedback on the ease of navigation, form usability, and course information clarity. Accessibility was prioritized, ensuring readable fonts, adequate contrast, and responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
Wireframes – Detailed Breakdown
The homepage features a clean layout with a prominent logo and call-to-action buttons guiding users to course summaries. The course summary pages list courses clearly, with clickable links to individual detail pages displaying comprehensive information and fees.

The quote calculator page contains a user-friendly form with validation, allowing users to select courses, enter contact details, and receive a real-time fee quote with discounts and VAT applied.

Navigation elements include a fixed top menu on web and a bottom navigation bar on mobile for quick access.
Logo Design – Deeper Meaning

The logo’s upward arrow and hands symbolize empowerment and support, resonating with the company's mission to uplift its learners. The chosen blue conveys trustworthiness, green emphasizes growth, and gold highlights opportunity and success, reinforcing the brand’s optimistic outlook.
